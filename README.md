# Choreo Sample - Grocery List Application

Welcome to the Choreo Gorcery List Application sample! This application is designed to help you get familiar with the [Choreo](https://console.choreo.dev/) platform and its features.

## Overview

This application is a multi-user Grocery list manager. It allows multiple users to maintain their own Grocery lists independently. Each user can add, remove, and view books in their personal Grocery list. It's built using the Choreo platform, showcasing its capabilities in building and deploying multi-user web applications.
